## About Me

My name is **Phat** (aka **Fast**) graduated from Viet Nam National Ho Chi Minh University, University of Information Technology(UIT). I am working as **Software Engineer** at **Sendo.vn**.

I am focusing on **ReactJS**, **TypeScript** and some related libraries, I started to say: "Hello World!" three years ago. I love coding with **ReactJS** because it has a special approach to web development. Instead of using server-side rendering, **ReactJS** uses client-side rendering as default.

Currently, beside my full-time job, I work as a freelancer using **ReactJS** as the main library to develop website in Javascript every night from 9PM to 12AM.

I had built some side-projects from simple to advanced combined with several useful Javascript libraries like **ReactJS**, **Redux**, **React Router**, **Redux Persist**, **Material-UI**, **Ant-design**, **Axios**, **Mongoose**...

You can refer it in [My Projects](/projects).
I also wrote some technical articles on Medium on my free time, you can refer them in [My Articles](/articles)

I have the ability and willingness to learn new techniques to improve my tech skills and career path.
I can manage my time, plan and do it with the highest commitment.
I try hard to develop web on Javascript every day with aim I can become a **Full-stack Javascript Developer** some days in the near future. The goal is never very difficult to reach with someone who always tries his best. I believe in it.
