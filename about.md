# About Me

My name is **Phat** graduated from Viet Nam National Ho Chi Minh University, University of Information Technology(UIT). I am working as ReactJS Developer at Sendo.vn.

I am focusing on React.js and some relavant libraries, I started to say: "Hello World!" three years ago. I love coding with React.js because it has a special approach to web development. Instead of using server-side rendering, React.js uses client-side rendering as default.

Currently, beside my full-time job, I work as a freelancer using ReactJS as the main library to develop website in Javascript every night from 9PM to 12AM.
I had built some side-projects from simple to advanced combined with several useful Javascript libraries like Redux, React Router Redux Persist, Axios, Mongoose... You can refer it in [projects](/projects)

I have the ability and willingness to learn new techniques to improve my tech skills and career path.
I can manage my time, plan and do it with the highest commitment.
I try hard to develop web on Javascript every day with aim I can become a **Full-stack Javascript Developer** some days in the near future. The goal is never very difficult to reach with someone who always tries his best. I believe in it.
