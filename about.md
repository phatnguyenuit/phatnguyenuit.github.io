# About Me

My name is **Phat** graduated from Viet Nam National Ho Chi Minh University, University of Information Technology(UIT). I have been working as Software Developer on **ERP/Odoo** for 2 years.

Odoo is an ERP web system. It was built by Python as main programming language, uses Bootstrap as CSS framework and Backbone.js as main web client structure to serve many and many built-in widgets. Odoo is all-in-one ERP software which helps users manage their business workflow easily.

While working on Odoo, besides understanding its functional business workflows, I realize that the website takes an important part needed to focus to make users have the best experience on our website. Since that, I started to focus on relevant front-end techniques.

Now I am focusing on React.js and some relavant libraries, I started to say: "Hello World!" one years ago. I love coding with React.js because it has a special approach to web development. Instead of using server-side rendering, React.js uses client-side rendering as default.

Currently, beside my full-time job, I work as a freelancer using ReactJS as the main library to develop website in Javascript every night from 9PM to 12AM.
I had built some side-projects from simple to advanced combined with several useful Javascript libraries like Redux, React Router Redux Persist, Axios, Mongoose... You can refer it in [projects](/projects)

I have the ability and willingness to learn new techniques to improve my tech skills and career path.
I can manage my time, plan and do it with the highest commitment.
I try hard to develop web on Javascript every day with aim I can become a **Full-stack Javascript Developer** some days in the near future. The goal is never very difficult to reach with someone who always tries his best. I believe in it.
