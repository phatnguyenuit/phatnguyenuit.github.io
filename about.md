## About Me

My name is **Phat** (aka **Fast**) graduated from Viet Nam National Ho Chi Minh University, University of Information Technology(UIT). Currently, I am working as a **Software Engineer** at [**Sendo.vn**](http://sendo.vn/).

I am focusing on **ReactJS**, **TypeScript** and some related libraries, I started to say: "Hello World!" in **Feb 2017**. I love coding with **ReactJS** because it has a special approach to web development by building components and combine together like a lego game. 
Instead of using server-side rendering, **ReactJS** uses client-side rendering as default.

I have been building some side-projects from simple to advanced combined with several useful Javascript libraries like **ReactJS**, **Redux**, **React Router**, **Redux Persist**, **Material-UI**, **Ant-design**, ....You can refer it in [My Projects](/projects).

I also write some technical articles on Medium in my free time, you can refer to them in [My Articles](/articles).
